/**
 * * Hello world!
 * 
 * The goal of this question is for you to edit, compile, and execute a simple C++ program. 
 * This is to ensure you have access to the necessary programming tools and are able to use 
 * them. You can then use the same tools later for more complex questions.
 * 
 * (a) Set up your programming environment. Refer to the section “A First C++ Programme” in the 
 * lecture notes for some suggestions for how to do this. In B16 we recommend the Visual Studio 
 * Code IDE, since this is widely used and runs on all common operating systems; or a text editor 
 * plus command line compiler. If you encounter problems, Stack Overflow is a good source of 
 * answers (as is Google).
 * 
 * (b) Write, compile, and execute a C++ programme which prints “Hello world!” to the console.
