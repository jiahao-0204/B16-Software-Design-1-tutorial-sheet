/**
 * * Object-oriented concepts
 * 
 * Explain the following concepts, and their significance, in the context of object-oriented programming:
 * 
 * ? (a) encapsulation
 * is the hiding of the implementation of the function from its interface. 
 * 
 * ? (b) compile-time polymorphism
 * when using 'template' or 'auto' keywords, the compiler will generate the required code automatically upon compilation
 * this reduce code redundancy and improve portability.
 * 
 * ? (c) run-time polymorphism
 * if a member function is declared virtual, upon execution of this function, the compiler will check any children class has 
 * overwritten the function, and will use the one defined in the children class if found.  
 *
